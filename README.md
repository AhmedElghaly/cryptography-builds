# cryptography-builds
The .whl file you built (cryptography-41.0.1-cp311-cp311-linux_armv7l.whl) is a Python Wheel package for the cryptography library, specifically compiled for Python 3.11 on an ARMv7l (32-bit) architecture.
What is this file?

    It is a pre-compiled binary package that allows users to install the cryptography library without needing to compile from          source.
    This is useful for embedded systems like the Raspberry Pi, where compiling can be slow and require additional dependencies.

# Why is this useful?

    Instead of building cryptography manually every time, users can install it quickly with:
    
    pip install cryptography-41.0.1-cp311-cp311-linux_armv7l.whl

Helps avoid build failures due to missing dependencies.
Great for deployment on multiple ARM-based devices.
